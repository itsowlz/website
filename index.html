<img src="images/ocean.jpg" alt="Ocean" class="center">
<h5>Name: Oceanic Nook</h5>
<p>A simple photograph of the ocean where the waves are crashing into the cliff. I was in Santa Cruz where I taken this photo and it was a shot
  I would always take when going to that beach spot in Santa Cruz. It took many trys to get the right picture so it did not happen all in one day. My friends
  did not want to wait for me to get the right picture, since either we would come too early and leave before the right light or get their too late and miss
  the golden hour light, but it took a week or two of constantly going here to make it the right picture I wanted. I was glad that the flowers were in bloom at
  that time so it gave me a better shot to work with making. The red pops out but it is not too much overwhelming the photograph where it seems lke all you see is read all the time.
